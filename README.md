# Loops
Free Code Camp - Iterate/Odd Numbers/Count Backwards/Nesting For Loops and Iterate with While Loops

Iterate with JavaScript For Loops 
Instructions:
- Use a for loop to work to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray.
- myArray should equal [1,2,3,4,5]


Iterate Odd Numbers With a For Loop
Instructions:
- Push the odd numbers from 1 through 9 to myArray using a for loop.
- myArray should equal [1,3,5,7,9].


Count Backwards With a For Loop 
Instructions:
- Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.
- myArray should equal [9,7,5,3,1].


Nesting For Loops 
Instructions:
- Modify function multiplyAll so that it multiplies the product variable by each number in the sub-arrays of arr
- multiplyAll([[1],[2],[3]]); should return 6
- multiplyAll([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6,7]]) should return 5040
- multiplyAll([[5,1],[0.2, 4, 0.5],[3, 9]]);) should return 54


Iterate with JavaScript While Loops 
Instructions
- You should be using a while loop for this.
- Push the numbers 0 through 4 to myArray using a while loop.
- myArray should equal [0,1,2,3,4]
